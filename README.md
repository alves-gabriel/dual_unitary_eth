# Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits
---

Here we provide the code and a minimal example for the results in the paper. The files as divided as:

- `example.ipynb` : a Jupyter notebook with an minimal example
- `du_circuits` : a library implementing all circuit operations, including the analytical results for the diagonaliztion of the integrable DU XXZ circuit
    -  `src` : source code and documentation with examples
    -  `test` : unit tests with some further examples
    -  `example_du` : a short example
- `quantum_many_body` : a folder with some utilities for QMB operations and operators
- `free_proability.py` : a class for performing diagram computations and free probability operations
- `random_circuits.py` : code implementing random circuits of somewhat general configurations. This is inherited from previous code, so the functionalities here are much more general than what is required in the paper (TODO: this might be simplified in a feuture commit).
